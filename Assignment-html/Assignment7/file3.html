    <p style="text-align: justify;">A day before Donald Trump meets Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Japan,
         the US President said he looked forward to speaking with Modi about a recent increase in its already high 
         tariffs against the United States.India imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US after withdrawal of key trade 
         privileges, which will lead to an increase in prices of almonds, walnuts and apples among other products.
