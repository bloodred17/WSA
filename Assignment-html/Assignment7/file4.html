     <hr size="5px", style="background-color: black;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">India is pressing for exemption from the high duty imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, 
        resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)
         programme, greater market access for its products from agriculture, automobile, automobile components and 
         engineering sectors.India imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US after withdrawal of key trade privileges, which
          will lead to an increase in prices of almonds, walnuts and apples among other products.
