    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Japan today for the G20 Summit during which he will 
        attend important plurilateral meetings and meet world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. This 
        will be Modi's sixth G20 Summit which is being held at Osaka on June 28-29.India imposed retaliatory tariffs
         on the US after withdrawal of key trade privileges, which will lead to an increase in prices of almonds, 
         walnuts and apples among other products.
